Flash News with River Waters is a financial news podcast made primarly as a skill for Amazon Alexa. The mp3 files are made to Amazon's specifications and uploaded directly to the repo. The JSON file is updated manually to reflect the past 5 days worth of data. The mp3 file then streams directly to Amazon Alexa from the Flash News website. 

This is a static website made using HTML, CSS, Javascript and deployed automatically using Githhub and Netlify.
